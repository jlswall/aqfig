## Resubmission

* I have fixed the \link{} targets to include a reference to the geoR
package, where mentioning the points.geodata() function from that package.

* This is a resubmission of a package which was archived in 2020.  In this
version, functions from the geoR, graphics, grDevices, and stats packages are now
  specified as being imported.
